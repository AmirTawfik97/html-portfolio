<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>
  Through my academic path, I learned several technical skill like different programming languages like Python, Java and C.
  Also I learned several tools like Matlab and Simulink for Modelling and control simulations, 2D and 3D software for
  mechanical design like AutoCAD and SolidWorks. My bachelor project is about design optimization for sports car frames which
  involves stress analysis using Finite Element Analysis "FEA". I paticipated in several activities during my education
  as I took the position of a Junior Teaching Assistant for Data Structure and Algorithms using Java to assist other students
  in their class. I took the responsiblity of an Usher to help students who plan to go for a semester abroad as I was spent
  a semester in Germany. After Graduation, I worked for the GUC as a research assitant for aconstruction project in the campus
  where I conducted stress analysisfor specific structural components using FEA. After that project, I got a job as an
  automotive maintenance engineer for 2 months. Later, I got hired for MCV, through my 3 years at MCV I worked on several projects
  with different scopes some where design development, modules testing and developed several software for conducting stress analysis
  and different essential bus design calculations using C++ and Matlab.

<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>
  Since my graduation in 2020, I kept improving my technical skills through courses. I learned Embedded Systems using C,
  Model-Based Design using Simuling for Embedded Systems, Modern C++ development, Data Structures and Algorithms,
  Design Patterns and SOLID Principles and Front-End Development. Also during my working experience at MCV I also learned different
  soft skills for problem handling, working under stress, communicating with different organizational categories as well as 
  learning additional software like PTC Creo and Altair Hypermesh.
